# KITP Galevo23 Tutorials

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DataDrivenGalaxyEvolution/galevo23-tutorials/)

This repository contains tutorials for the 2023 KITP hybrid program *Building a Physical Understanding of Galaxy Evolution with Data-driven Astronomy*. For the program schedule and additional information, take a look at our [website](https://datadrivengalaxyevolution.github.io) or [KITP listing](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/activities/galevo23).

## What are these tutorials?

The tutorial sessions will cover various topics in galaxy evolution and scientific machine learning. Some are designed to provide an introduction or overview of statistical and machine learning methods. Others focus on machine learning applications or answering specific scientific questions. 

Although each tutorial session is 1.5 hours long, we expect that the tutorial leads should keep their presentation to under an hour, which allows attendees to ask questions, work interactively, or discuss added topics. 

## Which topics are being covered in the tutorials?

Each week we will address a different set of scientific topics, and these **weekly themes** are now set for the virtual programs (see [here](https://datadrivengalaxyevolution.github.io/#virtualweeks)). We aim to have two tutorials per week, and will update this page as more details are finalized.

## Navigating through the tutorials

We hope that most of these tutorials can be run on the cloud (e.g. through Google Colab) or locally with minimal dependencies. However, we note that different tutorials have different authors, so the coding and writing style will not be consistent throughout the repository. 

To navigate to a tutorial, simply click on the week you're interested in (see above schedule) and find the relevant files for each tutorial. For example, if you want to open the *Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks* tutorial, go to `week-1` and then open `Introduction to convolutional neural networks.ipynb`. Note that you can also open this repository or the subdirectories in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DataDrivenGalaxyEvolution/galevo23-tutorials/).
